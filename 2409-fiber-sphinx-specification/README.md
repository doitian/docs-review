## Synopsis

Fiber Sphinx implements [Sphinx][Sphinx] using the same configuration as Bitcoin Lightning [BOLT#4][BOLT4]. As said in the Sphinx paper:

> Sphinx is a cryptographic message format used to relay anonymized messages within a mix network. It is more compact than any comparable scheme, and supports a full set of security features: indistinguishable replies, hiding the path length and relay position, as well as providing unlinkability for each leg of the message’s journey over the network.

Fiber uses Sphinx to facilitate the transmission of messages from an initial node to a destination node by utilizing a sequence of forwarding nodes. These nodes create a singly linked list, and the message transmitted between consecutive nodes is referred to as a hop.

Intermediate nodes can verify the packet's integrity and determine the next hop for forwarding. However, they have limited knowledge of the route. They only know their predecessor and successor nodes, and cannot learn about other nodes or the route's length. Additionally, the packet is obfuscated at each hop, preventing network-level attackers from associating packets on the same route.

The route is established by the origin node, which possesses the public keys of all intermediate nodes as well as the final node. With knowledge of these public keys, the origin node is able to generate a shared secret for each intermediate node and the final node using ECDH. This shared secret is utilized to create a pseudo-random stream of bytes, which is employed to obfuscate the packet. Additionally, the shared secret is used to generate multiple keys that are used for payload encryption and HMAC computation. These HMACs are then used to ensure packet integrity at each hop in the route.

## Definition

Assume that the origin node wants to send the message $m_{v-1}$ to node $n_{v-1}$ and it has found a path $(n_0, n_1, \cdots, n_{v-1})$ where $n_0, n_1, \cdots, n_{v-2}$ are forwarding nodes. The data $m_0, m_1, \cdots, m_{v-2}$ are control messages sent to forwarding nodes where $m_i$ is the control message for the node $n_i$. The origin node can optionally attach the associated data $A$ that all the nodes can verify the integrity of the associated data $A$.

Each node $n_i$ has a secp256k1 private key $x_i$. The origin node knows the corresponding public keys $y_i = G^{x_i}$ for each node.

$L$ is a setup constant that the origin node must create a packet of length $L$ for $n_0$, and each forwarding node will construct the forwarding packet of length $L$ as well. $L$ must be larger enough to hold the messages $m_0, m_1, \cdots, m_{v-1}$ plus $32v$ bytes of HMACs for integrity verification.

## Packet Construction

### Keys Generation

Pick a random secp256k1 private key $x$ as the session key.

Compute a sequence of $v$ tuples $(\alpha_i, s_i, b_i, \mu_i, \rho_i)$ for each node $n_i$. For the first hop:

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
\alpha_0 =& g^x \\
s_0 =& y_{0}^x \\
b_0 =& h_b(\alpha_0, s_0) \\
\mu_0 =& h_\mu(s_0) \\
\rho_0 =& h_\rho(s_0) \\
\end{array}
$$

Denote the product of $b_0, b_1, \cdots, b_{i-1}$ as $\prod_{k=1}^{i-1}{b_k}$. For the following hops:

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
\alpha_i =& g^{x \prod_{k=1}^{i-1}{b_k} } \\
s_i =& y_{i}^{x \prod_{k=1}^{i-1}{b_k} } \\
b_i =& h_b(\alpha_i, s_i) \\
\mu_i =& h_\mu(s_i) \\
\rho_i =& h_\rho(s_i) \\
\end{array}
$$

The $\alpha_i$ are ephemeral secp256k1 public keys, the $s_i$ are the Diffie-Hellman shared secrets, $b_i$ are the blinding factors, $\mu_i$ are keys to compute HMACs, and $\rho_i$ are keys to generate Chacha20 cipher stream to encrypt messages. The $x\prod_{k=1}^{i-1}{b_k}$ are corresponding private keys of $\alpha_i$, and $g$ is the generator of secp256k1.

The $\alpha_i$ are secp256k1 points, the $b_i$ are integers modulo the secp256k1 prime order $q$, and $s_i, \mu_i, \rho_i$ are 32-byte binaries.

There are there hash function used in the equations: $h_b$, $h_\mu$, and $h_\rho$.

- $h_b: (\alpha_i, s_i) \to b_i$ computes SHA256 on the concatenation of the $\alpha_i$ compressed serialization and $s_i$, decodes the SHA256 result into an integer in big-endian and gets the modulus of the decoded value with $q$.
- $h_\mu: (s_i) \to \mu_i$ computes HMAC-SHA256 on $s_i$ by using 2 bytes `0x6d75` (utf8 encoding of the text "mu") as the key.
- $h_\rho: (s_i) \to \rho_i$ computes HMAC-SHA256 on $s_i$ by using 3 bytes `0x72686F` (utf8 encoding of the text "rho") as the key.

### Filler Generation

Filler is used to fill the blanks when a hop removes its message from the packet. It is generated by using the $\mu_i$ from $\mu_0$ to $\mu_{v-2}$ incrementally.

Let $\phi_0$ be an empty string. For $0 \lt i \lt v$:

$$
\phi_i = \mathsf{Chacha20}(\rho_{i-1})[(L-\lvert \phi_{i-1} \rvert)..(L + \lvert m_{i-1} \rvert)] \oplus \\{\phi_{i-1} \Vert 0_{\lvert m_{i-1} \rvert} \\}
$$

Where
- $0_b$ means the string of 0 bits of length $b$ bytes.
- $\mathsf{Chacha20}(\rho_{i-1})$ is a Chacha20 cipher stream with the key $\rho_{i-1}$ and iv $0_{12}$.
- $\mathsf{Chacha20}(\rho_{i-1})[a..b]$ means the substring of is the string of $\mathsf{Chacha20}$ consisting of bytes a (inclusively) through b (exclusively). The substring has the length $b - a$. The string index starts from 0.
- $\Vert$ denotes concatenation
- $\lvert s \rvert$ is the length of string $s$
- $a \oplus b$ applies XOR on strings $a$ and $b$.

This step is illustrated in Figure 1.

### Creating a Forwarding Message

Create a Chacha20 cipher stream $P$ of length $L$ for the initial noise. The Chacha20 stream key is $h_{\mathit{pad}}(x)$, the HMAC-SHA256 on the session key $x$ by using 3 bytes `0x706164` (utf8 encoding of the text "pad") as the HMAC key. The cipher stream iv is $0_{12}$.

$$
P = \mathsf{Chacha20}(h_{\mathit{pad}}(x))
$$

Compute a sequence of $v$ tuples $(\beta_i, \gamma_i)$ for each node $n_i$ incrementally in the reverse order. For the last node $n_{v-1}$:

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
\beta' _{v-1} =& \\{m _{v-1} \Vert 0 _{32} \Vert P[0..(L-\lvert \phi _{v-1}\rvert -\lvert m _{v-1}\rvert - 32)]\\} \oplus \mathsf{Chacha20}(\rho _{v-1})[0..(L-\lvert \phi _{v-1}\rvert)] \\
\beta _{v-1} =& \beta' _{v-1} \Vert \phi _{v-1} \\
\gamma _{v-1} =& \mathsf{HMAC\textrm{-}SHA256}(\mu _{v-1}, \beta _{v-1} \Vert A)
\end{array}
$$

Where
- $0_b$ means the string of 0 bits of length $b$ bytes.
- $\mathsf{Chacha20}(\rho_{i-1})$ is a Chacha20 cipher stream with the key $\rho_{i-1}$ and iv $0_{12}$.
- $\mathsf{Chacha20}(\rho_{i-1})[a..b]$ means the substring of is the string of $\mathsf{Chacha20}$ consisting of bytes a (inclusively) through b (exclusively). The substring has the length $b - a$. The string index starts from 0.
- $\Vert$ denotes concatenation
- $\lvert s \rvert$ is the length of string $s$
- $a \oplus b$ applies XOR on strings $a$ and $b$.
- $\mathsf{HMAC\textrm{-}SHA256}(k, s)$ computes HMAC-SHA256 on the string $s$ by using $k$ as the HMAC key.

See the annotations description in the previous section Filler Generation.

For node $n_i$ that $0 \le i \lt v-1$:

$$
\begin{array}{rl}
\beta_{i} =& \\{m_{i} \Vert \gamma_{i+1} \Vert \beta_{i+1}[0..(L-\lvert m_{i} \rvert - 32)] \\} \oplus \mathsf{Chacha20}(\rho_{i})[0..L] \\
\gamma_{i} =& \mathsf{HMAC\textrm{-}SHA256}(\mu_{i}, \beta_{i} \Vert A) \\
\end{array}
$$

The forward message is the tuple $(\alpha_0, \beta_0, \gamma_0)$, and should be sent to $n_0$.

This step is illustrated in Figure 2.
